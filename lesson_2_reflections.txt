What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    Initializing a repository creates a empty Git repository structure for performing version control of all the files in the folder from which Git was initialized.
    I needed to do it as it is necessary first step before any files to be setup for version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    Staging area has all the files that will be commited as a group to the repository.
    Any file not part of a staging area will not be tracked or commited during the commit.
    The value of staging area is that it provides a logical grouping of files before actual commit takes place.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
