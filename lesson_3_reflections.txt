When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    Rather than keeping all my work local, I would want to use a remote repository when I would need to collaborate with other people on any project.
    Remote repository helps everyone connect to a common source files with all recent changes and add their own changes.
    I would also use remote repository if I would like to share my work with others so that I can get any feedback.
    Other people can use my work and change it for their own needs.
    Remote repository also helps if I need to work on the same project from a different computer at a different location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Rather than Git automatically staying up-to-date with my remote repository, I want to always manually pull changes because it helps me evaluate if I need to incorporate the changes on the remote repository into the project.
    Going through the remote repository log if I feel that I would like to try out the changes made to remote repository without affecting my current project, I can always create a branch and then pull changes.
    This also helps in preventing any unwanted changes getting into my project and breaking things.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    Forks are clones made inside GitHub from existing repositories in GitHub to my account which provides attribution to the original author.
    Forks are used when I want to work on a project I found on GitHub where I don't have permission to make changes but would like to credit the original author.

    Clones are copies of repositories from existing repositories in GitHub to my local machine.
    Clones are used when I want to work on a project I found on GitHub, but don't want to add it to my account on GitHub.
    I can also use cloning when I don't have a GitHub account and want to work on an existing project.
    Cloning is also used for importing any forks done inside GitHub to local computer.

    Branches are copies of existing repository in the local machine.
    Branches are used if I would want to try any experimental features and don't want to impact the main project.
    In the future if I feel that I have finished experimenting with the branch, I can then merge the branch with the main project after resolving any conflicts.
